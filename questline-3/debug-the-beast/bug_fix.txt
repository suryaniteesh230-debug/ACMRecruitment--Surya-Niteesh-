Bug:
The original code updated "second" whenever num > second,
but it did not check whether num == largest.
This caused the program to return the same number as both
largest and second largest if the maximum repeated.

Fix:
Added an extra condition "num != largest" in the elif statement.
Now the second largest is always different from the largest.
